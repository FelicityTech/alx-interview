# Prime Game

Prime Game is a mathematical game in which two players take turns selecting a positive integer from a given range of integers. The goal of the game is to be the last player to select a prime number.

The rules of the Prime Game are as follows:

1. Two players take turns selecting a positive integer from a given range of integers.
2. The first player must select an odd number, and subsequent numbers chosen by both players must be odd.
The number chosen by each player must be a prime number.
3. The player who chooses the last prime number wins the game.
For example, suppose the range of integers is from 1 to 10. The game might proceed as follows:

Player 1 selects 3 (the only odd prime number in the range).
Player 2 selects 5.
Player 1 selects 7 (the only remaining odd prime number in the range).
Player 2 selects 2 (not a prime number, so this move is not allowed).
Player 1 wins the game, since there are no remaining prime numbers for Player 2 to choose.
The Prime Game can be played with any range of positive integers, and the strategy for winning depends on the range of integers and the skill of the players.
